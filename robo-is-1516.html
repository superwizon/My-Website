        <h1>ATR -- Alternative Terrain Robotics</h1>
        <p>ATR is a collaboration between high school students, Isaac Zinda and Wilson Rawlings. Together they strive to create interesting robots that traverse interesting terrain in interesting ways. The project has been worked on during an Independent study, in which the two have designed, built, coded, and tested their creation. ATR Mrk. 1.</p>
        <h1>Mrk. 1</h1>
        <p><strong>Where it Started</strong></p>
        <p>We wanted to design a robot to climb on a alternative terrain that neither of us and worked on before. We narrowed our choices between Veritcal Glass (with suction cups) or Swarm Robotics (many small robots that work together to accomplish a task. We decided on the Glass climbing option due to the fact that we thought, in the time we had, complete a project that was fully capable of scaling the surface. We immediately got to work researching suction cups and designing arms.</p>
        <p><strong>Initial Ideas and Prototypes</strong></p>
        <p>Our first step was to research suction cups. We found two promising systems. We ordered an electronic assembly line suction cup and also a DIY suction, tube, and pump system. After testing we decided on the DIY version due to the fact that the other required that the suction be completely flat on the surface to engage suction force.</p>
        <p><strong>Further Ideas and Prototypes</strong></p>
        <p>After we decided on the DIY suctions, we began to test to figure out how to make them work how we wanted them to. We realized that we needed to design a part that would effectively hold the suctions and keep the robot from falling of the window. Our holders fit around the outside of the suction cups and allow the tubes to travel through the top. They then attach to the chassis. We tested and quickly found that how they were mounted would not work well enough. While this suction system did not need to be entirely flat against the window to work, they need to be somewhat flat. We added hinges and springs but this was not exact enough.</p>
        <p><strong>Final Product</strong></p>
        <p>After much more testing, we created sevo adjustable suction cups (for alignment on window) found and added in valves, and assembled the electronics to pair with the code we created. At this point we have a window climbing robot that is controllable from two joysticks.</p>
        <p><strong>Takeaway</strong></p>
        <p>Through the course of our two-trimester project, we learned how to use Computer Assisted Design, paired with a 3D printer and laser cutter, to design a product from start to finish. We have proved the feasibility of our approach, but lack the time and resources to meet all of our goals for this project. The robot was only able to climb in small stints and could not support the weight of it's own battery. However, we consider the first attempt a success and hope others will expand on our work.</p>
