			<p class="aboutme-p">Every summer for the past 8 years I have attended a month long summer camp in Colorado Called <a href="http://www.sanbornwesterncamps.com" class="sanborn-web">Sanborn Western Camps.</a> This place has shaped who I am today. Without the experiences I have had at Sanborn and the things I have learned there I would be a very different person. I have learned leadeship skills, outdoor ethics, outdoor survival skils, outdoor navigational skills, how to be prepared, and how to have safe fun in the backcountry. I have many friend from around the country that I see only there year after year.</p>
